1. What work have you found most technically challenging in your career and why?

The work that I've found the most challenging was when I first started at SAP Concur.  I was asked to
write in Ansible (which I had never used before) and essentially combine a few SAP tools together into 
one process.  I integrated BAF, API calls, Buildhub and slack to automate the security scanning process
using SSRS.  By using my tool, developers could have new security scans initated for them when they
updated their code on buildhub.  This was technically challenging getting all of these pieces working together
when I was still trying to understand what each of them did seperately and in my first industry experience.

2. What work have you done that you were particularly proud of and why?

I have been most proud of my work to rebuild the scan engines in Integrations for our team at SAP Concur.
This process took quite some time, from working with Image Factory to create custom AMI's in each AWS location,
to then using cloud formation to create these scan engines in each environment.  I had to then configure the
engines in the Nexpose Admin Console, as well as editing files on the box and restarting them.  I also tested
each engine after creating to make sure they scanned. There were many issues I had to fix along the way, but ultimately
was able to move from using C54XL boxes, to M5XL in smaller environemnts and C52XL in the larger ones.  This saved us
money after deleting the old engines.

3. When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?

I have been most happy in my professional career when I can see what I'm working on making an impact.  I am perfectly happy
doing the work others don't want to do, even if it takes a long time or is for whatever reason is undesirable.  I am happy
though when I can see that what I did was important and helped out the team.  

4. When have you been unhappiest in your professional career and why?

I have been most unhappy when I can not see the value of my work, or am stuck for a long period of time.  As someone newer to
the industry, there have been times where I have been stuck or confused, having the time and desire to work, but nobody to help
get me there.  This especially has happened when my team was working on their PSCC deployment and needing to focus all of their time
on that.  

5. For one of SAP Concur's values, describe an example of how it was reflected in a particular body of your work.

The SAP Concur value of staying curious has been very important to me in all of my work at the company so far.  Esepcially, this value was reflected in my work over the summer with the work I mentioned in question 1.  This work required me to constantly be researching, asking questions, and learning on my own to discover how various technologies worked so I could then make them to work together.  This meant having humility and asking good questions, understanding that I need help from people around me who had been working longer and having determination and the desire to work hard.

6. For one of SAP Concur's values, describe an example of how it was violated in your organization or work.

I can not think of a time in which one of SAP Concur's values was violated in my time at SAP Concur.

7. For a pair of SAP Concur's values, describe a time in which the two values came into tension for you or your work, and how you resolved it.

A time that two values came in tension was in the months following the summer as I was continuing work at SAP Concur in the school year.  I had worked on a great project over the summer that had automated the security scanning process.  I really wanted to keep the project going and get people using it, but other things came up within the team, especially PSCC deployment which meant the project needed to be put on hold.  I wanted to stick to the value of keeping promises and delivering my product to others, who I had told it would be coming.  This came in conflict when my manager said that we needed to move on from the project and that it might not actually end up being feasible, or at least for now there were more important things to work on.  This represented the value of staying curious, being willing to accept change and continue to innovate.  I was disappointed to see something I had worked on for so long not be used, but realized it was better to stay curious and continue innovating rather being stuck on something that might not actually work.

8. Why do you want to work for SAP Concur?

I want to work for SAP Concur because I have had an amazing experience so far here for the last year.  Coming in as an intern, I had no professional experience in the industry.  All I wanted to do was learn as much as possible and take in as much as I could.  After a year here, I still hold that same attitude as I still have so much I can learn from the people around me.  I've been giving exciting and meaningful projects that I have completed, and I can proudly say I've completed everything thats been assigned to me over my time here.  The people at this company are so kind, and I love the collaboration that has happened within my team especially.  Even though it is a big company, I would run into people I knew around the office which made it feel comfortable.  I was very excited to continue working full time with my current team at SAP Concur after graduation, and having that taken away due to COVID budget cuts was disappointing.  I would be excited for the opportunity to challenge myself by learning new things in a different team and meeting new people.  Most of all, I would love to continue working at SAP Concur to continue building the relationships I've formed here in the last year.
