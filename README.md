1. What work have you found most technically challenging in your career and why?

The work that I've found the most challenging was when I first started at SAP Concur.  I was asked to
write in Ansible (which I had never used before) and essentially combine a few SAP tools together into 
one process.  I integrated BAF, API calls, Buildhub and slack to automate the security scanning process
using SSRS.  By using my tool, developers could have new security scans initated for them when they
updated their code on buildhub.  This was technically challenging getting all of these pieces working together
when I was still trying to understand what each of them did seperately and in my first industry experience.

2. What work have you done that you were particularly proud of and why?

I have been most proud of my work to rebuild the scan engines in Integrations for our team at SAP Concur.
This process took quite some time, from working with Image Factory to create custom AMI's in each AWS location,
to then using cloud formation to create these scan engines in each environment.  I had to then configure the
engines in the Nexpose Admin Console, as well as editing files on the box and restarting them.  I also tested
each engine after creating to make sure they scanned. There were many issues I had to fix along the way, but ultimately
was able to move from using C54XL boxes, to M5XL in smaller environemnts and C52XL in the larger ones.  This saved us
money after deleting the old engines.

3. When have you been happiest in your professional career and why?

I have been most happy in my professional career when I can see what I'm working on making an impact.  I am perfectly happy
doing the work others don't want to do, even if it takes a long time or is for whatever reason is undesirable.  I am happy
though when I can see that what I did was important and helped out the team.
